## Usage

1. Start the server:
    ```sh
    node index.js
    ```
2. The server will be running on [`http://localhost:3000`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3000%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22c%3A%5C%5CUsers%5C%5Cparulmahajan%5C%5COneDrive%20-%20Microsoft%5C%5CDesktop%5C%5CDeliveries%5C%5CGitHub%20for%20Developers%5C%5Cbasic-node-application%5C%5Cindex.js%22%2C%22_sep%22%3A1%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fc%253A%2FUsers%2Fparulmahajan%2FOneDrive%2520-%2520Microsoft%2FDesktop%2FDeliveries%2FGitHub%2520for%2520Developers%2Fbasic-node-application%2Findex.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fparulmahajan%2FOneDrive%20-%20Microsoft%2FDesktop%2FDeliveries%2FGitHub%20for%20Developers%2Fbasic-node-application%2Findex.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A66%2C%22character%22%3A20%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition").

## Endpoints

- `GET /generate-token`: Generates a JWT token.

- `GET /app/json`: Fetches data from an external API and caches the response. Requires a valid JWT token.

## Middleware

- **Rate Limiting**: Limits the number of requests to 5 per minute per IP.
- **Logging**: Logs the timestamp, IP address, and rate limit status of each request.
- **Token Verification**: Verifies the JWT token provided in the [`authentication`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22authentication%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22c%3A%5C%5CUsers%5C%5Cparulmahajan%5C%5COneDrive%20-%20Microsoft%5C%5CDesktop%5C%5CDeliveries%5C%5CGitHub%20for%20Developers%5C%5Cbasic-node-application%5C%5Cindex.js%22%2C%22_sep%22%3A1%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fc%253A%2FUsers%2Fparulmahajan%2FOneDrive%2520-%2520Microsoft%2FDesktop%2FDeliveries%2FGitHub%2520for%2520Developers%2Fbasic-node-application%2Findex.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fparulmahajan%2FOneDrive%20-%20Microsoft%2FDesktop%2FDeliveries%2FGitHub%20for%20Developers%2Fbasic-node-application%2Findex.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A35%2C%22character%22%3A36%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") header.
